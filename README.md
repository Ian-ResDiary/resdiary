###Setting up GitHub repo on VM
We have an online GitHub repo for many reasons. Its easier for the customer and probably easier to mark for the university staff. While you can just make a local clone of a repo we should probably incorporate this into the VM in some way. From what I can tell there are two ways we can go about this:
1. Test
- test

###Outside of lab access to TRAC / VM
Fire up the terminal and enter:
``` 
ssh -L 8000:130.209.251.67:80 <yourGUID>@sibu.dcs.gla.ac.uk
```
- To access the TRAC page visit (http://localhost:8000/projects/myproject/)
- To access the VM just sign in as you do on the lab machines.
