This is a test.

I am at home on the VM for the project having figured out TRAC home access. SSH wizard, sudo scientist, etc.

Do we need to use the VM git or is GitHub alone sufficent?

Should we somehow try to tie the two together?

###  ADDITION THEN COMMIT ###

For this I just cloned the repo into my local teamproject directory for the VM on my account.

### NEXT TEST ###

What I've done now is add the resdiary cloned repo to the VM repo.

Now I'm making a change to this repo - making the commit then checking the status of the VM repo rather than the cloned repo. This all makes sense to me at this moment in time. 

Play with things until they break. 

Play with matches because sometimes you just have to get burned, etc.

### ANOTHER PERFECT DAY ###
There's a TRAC Git plugin to allow for ticket closing via commit messages

Only way to check if it's setup before investigating is to make a commit

This is a commit and reminder to look into that
